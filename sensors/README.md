This category groups reusable sensor and device bridge workflows extracted from past interactive art projects.  
Modules are organized by **function type**.

## Function Types

- Arduino
- Thermal
- Leap Motion
- MQTT bridge

## Notes

- These modules focus on external hardware input or device communication
- Setup requirements may vary depending on hardware, drivers, or communication method
- Details are documented inside each function folder
